    summary: "The semicolon has become both an emblematic feature of the JavaScript language as well as a point of much confusion and debate. While there are some areas of a JavaScript file where the use of a semicolon is generally well understood, there are many more areas where people second-guess, or worse, debate the necessity and usefulness of the punctuation mark.",

    summary: "The introduction of investment trusts to the general public in the 1920s set into motion a significant change in the way that laymen interacted with financial markets.

Over time, the rift between the financial system and the everyday citizen became even smaller.",
